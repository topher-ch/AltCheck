https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1613246#taiko/3293724 (slight RH Bias)
https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2042964#taiko/4263291 (RH Bias on 5-note 1/4 bursts)

Tech:
https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2392651#taiko/5186318 (no bias on 1/2, almost all nested 1/6 are off RH however on 1/4)
https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2392651#taiko/5186728 (RH bias on bursts between 10 and 24 notes long, however no noticeable biases on nested 1/6)
https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1407228#taiko/2901604 (many long tech streams, largely start of RH but extremely high rhythm complexity)
https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2350118#taiko/5056926 (most 1/6 patterns come in even note lengths, implying likely simple 1/4 + 1/6 combinations)
https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2260133#taiko/4810198 (small RH bias, but largely consistent rhythm complexity)

https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2167213#taiko/4572334 (this one doesn't catch too much rhythm complexity at first glance, but seemingly a RH bias in the 10-24 range)
https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2167213#taiko/4572333 (funnily enough, the lower diff has LH bias)
